## Extract
Computing and programming passionate.

The web FrontEnd area is my is my strongest skill, the one I've focused on the most throughout my career, but not the only. I have extensive knowledge on all the aspects related to web applications, from the ui to the backend, api's, data, networking / performance, ci/cd, infrastructure, and the main providers.

From my engineering background, I have had always the need to know how everything worked, how the different parts worked together to produce the things we


Professionally, not only I have been in several companies, each in its own universe, but I also developed all by myself projects which span the whole spectrum, as a software architect. With that I mean devising all the pieces that will form a whole structure, to solve a customer's particular needs.

From the requirements definition, to drafting an entity relationship model. Discussing what storage technologies would be adequate, relational, non-relational, graph based. Defining a Restful API contract, implementing it using any technology.
Designing a user interface aiming at the best possible user experience, adapted to the technology needs: desktop, mobile.
Defining the whole architecture on the cloud: what servers are needed, and what capacity are they going to support. It could be that a frontend is served from an edge CDN, while the backend is isolated from the internet and the public access point is a load balancer to distribute the load. AWS, Google cloud platform, Azure, Firebase, Digitalocean. They all do basically the same thing, but normally the choice depends on the requirements of the customer. (They may already have a contract with Microsoft, or with Google Apps...).

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### Freelance Web Developer Jan 2010 - Present

I have been fiddling with web technologies since very young, becoming more experienced through the
years and later accepting private contracts with clients. In the projects section you can see a portfolio of
products built.
More details can be found in the Projects section of this resume.

### Software Engineer Sep 2019 - Present
marketScape.com
Crawling the internet, in order to collect data about specific topics from different sources. Normalize,
analysis and synthesis of this date, in order to find and group differentiative elements from that topic. A
topic can be anything: fashion market trends, consumption of alcohol, music reproductions, drug
consumption, religious fanatism.
Sources can be anything that feeds data from the public, social networks, polls, reports.
So depending on every use case, the election of sources and topics can deliver the following:
- Gain advantadge over the competence by reacting fast.
- Iterate on the data, decide business strategy based on it.
- Detect criminal groups, isolate hot spots of activity, find bad people.
My role here is not only frontend but also architect of the different parts of the software. My main expertise
and where I focused more is on the frontend layer, using angular8 , make a less monolithic structure.
However I also helped to migrate towards a micro-services-oriented API , contributed on better ways to
store and fetch the data, how to design the algorithmics for the web spiders, as well as dev-ops tasks like
making the develop - test - deploy cycle simpler and faster.

### Senior Frontend Developer Feb 2019 - Aug 2019
Kasaz.com
Joined this little startup that aims at the real estate sector in Barcelona, bringing fresh and innovative ideas.
My task has been to boost the front part of the site's visibility and quality, using my acquired skills over the
years. So after some study, I designed a plan.
Conversion from a server-side rendering server to a compiled SPA on React. Well not exactly single, because
it has some static sections, so actually a Multi-Page application, keeping the main business logic on a small
package. SEO-wise, we don't want to break current search engines ranks, so we have to keep server side
rendering. So implement a system that renders on the server, with a piece of code that "hydrates" the static
site, converting it to an SPA, only if the client supports javascript.
Work together with a designer to create a branding. Re-design the structure of the page to make it more
intuitive, easier to use. Keep it simple: cut a lot of unnecessary content or sections, or move it somewhere
else, so that users don't look cluttered, and it doesn't cause distractions.
SEO: Try to follow all the standards and guides provided by search engines. Eliminate all penalising things, or
things that make the search engine think you are cheating, like for example, hidden texts, duplicate url's, etc..

### Senior Frontend Developer Oct 2017 - Nov 2018
Haufe-Umantis AG
Working as a frontend developer expert in technologies such as React (+Redux,Router,..) and Angular(1,2,4).

### Senior Frontend Developer Feb 2016 - Mar 2017

with buyers, through a web platform. It's free for clients to register on the website, however ad publishers
have to pay a monthly subscription to be able to post their ads. There are different subscription tiers, from
the simple ones, to the premium ones, which also allow you to access in-depth analytics of client behaviour
and user tracking.
I was hired as a Javascript developer, in a team of 4 people including me. My role was initially to work
closely with the team lead to study their current infrastructure to find potential bottlenecks and improve the
whole stack with a more modern philosophy. This was accomplished on 4 main levels:
1.- Refactored an old PHP server-side rendered codebase towards a dynamic - client side rendered with
Javascript.
2.- Proposed a migration from monolithic architecture to a micro-service oriented structure; trying to isolate
components with isolate responsibilities from the other parts. For example, we implemented a new image
treatment micro-service which allowed for on-demand resizing, conversion, and overall image
manipulation.
3.- Implement testing for the frontend, on two levels: unit-testing for dumb function behaviour, using mocha
and chai for assertions, and end-to-end testing for browser expectations; using JSDom to render pages.
4.- Automate the frontend code building process: Using gulp to gather all dependencies, concatenate all
the javascript files, compile Sass to css, render html templates, etc.
On another side I also worked in a company's side project made entirely with React+Redux, with Jest+
Enzyme for component/end-to-end testing. On this part I proposed to move the codebase from ES5 to a
more modern ES6 based code
My role was initially to assess the status and get a feel for the whole stack, reporting to a team lead, but
after 2 months the team lead was promoted to CTO and I, in turn, to the frontend team lead. I had to
manage the 3 developers work, we used Pivotal as a time tracker / task organiser. We did daily SCRUM
meetings and weekly reports of team performance.

### Co-founder / Frontend Lead Jan 2015 - April 2017
Medbrain
I founded a company with an ambitious project in mind. Medbrain was meant to be a healthcare
knowledge sharing platform and social network.
Medical students would get access to quality information and knowledge, and healthcare professionals
could keep up with the latest improvements. It was designed to split the knowledge in all areas of the
medicine, from a top-bottom perspective, and split by the different approaches it may have: Medical,
Surgical, Biomedical, Pharmacological, and Physiological. It would offer 3 main areas:
1.- A social Wall for each medical specialisation, where users could post and ask about anything related to
that area.
2.- A knowledge encyclopedia, built by all users, with an edition / submission / approval system similar to
wikipedia.
3.- A learning section, which would offer exercises to train on that particular area. This area would also be
extended on a later stage to also allow universities to evaluate their students.
I was the only front-end developer for the whole time. We achieved an alpha prototype, even launched a
private beta for one university. Later on, as we received funding, I was kicked out of the project; in short, there
was a big disagreement between me and the other 2 developers. The CEO had to choose between keeping
me or the other 2 developers. A more thorough explanation can be provided, if needed.

This was a Typeform-like survey app, commissioned from a non profit public organisation, funded by the "
Comunidad de Madrid". It is mainly a mobile interactive quiz, meant to look appealing to the younger
generations, with alot of focus on visual attractiveness while mantaining fluidity. The project was online for
as long as the campaign lasted, so it cannot be checked anymore, although I can provide code or even
showcase the app running locally. The organization is https://plataformadeinfancia.org/.
Aurepdos
This is a company that creates sensor panels, aimed for industrial applications that require a high volume
of data monitoring. During my phase we were focusing on industrial clothes cleaning automated trains. The
project was to develop an inhouse dashboard, to be able to display tons of metrics coming from the data
layer, where customers could then print out customized reports , and display many visual representations
out of the data.
